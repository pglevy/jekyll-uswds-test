          <h1>Primary Own Vehicle (POV)</h1>

          <div>
                  <h3>Allowed, largely at your own expense.</h3>

                  <h4>For <abbr title="Continental United States">CONUS</abbr>:</h4>

                  <ul>
                    <li>The cost of transporting your privately-owned vehicles to your new <abbr title="Permanent Change of Station">PCS</abbr> is largely your responsibility.</li>
                    <li>The military will reimburse you for the mileage associated with driving your <abbr title="Privately-Owned Vehicle">POV</abbr> according to the <a href="#TODO"><abbr title="Department of Defense">DOD</abbr> <abbr title="Permanent Change of Station">PCS</abbr> Mileage Reimbursement rate</a>.</li>
                    <li>If you decide not to drive your <abbr title="Privately-Owned Vehicle">POV</abbr> to your next duty station, you are 100% responsible for any cost relating to shipment of your vehicle. (In some cases, a POV shipment can be requested and authorized if the service member physically cannot drive their car because of geographical or medical limitations.)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4>For <abbr title="Outside the Continental United States">OCONUS</abbr>:</h4>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Only 1 vehicle (owned or leased) for personal use may be shipped at government expense.</li>
                    <li>The vehicle cannot exceed 20 measurement tons (MT). To calculate your <abbr title="Privately-Owned Vehicle">POV</abbr>’s measurement tonnage, multiply its length by its width by its height (in inches), divide by 1728 (this gives you the cubic feet of your <abbr title="Privately-Owned Vehicle">POV</abbr>), and then divide by 40 to obtain your <abbr title="Privately-Owned Vehicle">POV</abbr>’s measurement tonnage (<code>((L × W × H) / 1728) / 40</code>).</li>
                    <li>If you have a unique situation or if you want to make your own arrangements to ship an additional vehicle, please consult with <a href="/resources/locator-maps">your local transportation office</a>.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                    <p>If you are travelling overseas (OCONUS) and are interested in arranging your own vehicle storage, you will need to complete the Personally Procured Vehicle Storage Form and submit to your local personal property office. Reimbursements for self-arranged POV Storage are limited to the government’s comparative cost.</p>

                    <p>Effectively immediately, the Air Force inspection standard for HHG, unaccompanied baggage, non-temporary storage, and local move shipments into, out of, or within a Transportation Officer’s Area of Responsibility is increased from 50% to 80%.</p>
